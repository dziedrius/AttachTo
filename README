**This is fork of http://github.com/whut/AttachTo**

**I've added in my fork better support of attaching to IIS.**
Thing is, that if at the attachment moment are more than 1 w3wp.exe processes alive (for example there are running WCF and ASP.NET applications) 
there's a possibility, that debugger will attach to wrong IIS process.
So what I'm doing differenty from original project - I'm scanning soluttion projects and when find first Web project, take its IIS url and use it to find right application pool.

Adds "Attach to IIS", "Attach to IIS Express" and "Attach to NUnit" commands to Tools menu.

Now you can start debugging web site hosted in local IIS server or failing NUnit test quicker than before:) 

AttachTo extension provides options to hide commands not relevant to you. You can also assign shortcut using Tools -> Options -> Keyboard.
